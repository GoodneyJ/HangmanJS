##About

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

Just a basic Hangman game that I made in a couple hours. I made the images and the design in figma then coded it in.
It chooses a random word from state and gives the player up to 4 wrong guesses before it locks them out and they have to hit the reset button which clears all applied classes and state as well as chooses another random word.

##Dependencies

I used SASS, but I don't think that will mess you up if you don't have it. Maybe just get rid of the Sass file & Map. Might have to remove it from the package.json as well
https://sass-lang.com/

I also used React-Icons

##Extras

The original design I came up with in figma, its a bit different but it do be like that sometimes

The video I took shows my screen being kinda glitchy, from what I understand its something thats happening because of something in firefox. It doesn't happen on my other monitor though so I'm not quite sure. Been meaning to fix it but i've been to focused on code stuff haha. Hopefully its nothing too serious ðŸ‘€
